# YoutubeTyper
A small program designed to insert the details of an uploading youtube video.
Much like some of the other personal projects I've found in my files, I uploaded the files essentially as I found them to github in the master branch.
In this case, I had a small error to fix after importing the project into eclipse, but other than that, the master branch is a backup of the original files.

The develop branch is intended to be the working version after the application of the changes made in the feat/ branches.
